# INFRAStructure as CODE

## Purpose

All infrastructure used in my courses and research is now deployed over Kubernetes and/or other container technologies. I've provided the manifests and/or other components here in hopes that others find them useful as well.

## TLDR

Each directory contains it's own REAME related to deploying/using those resources including useful tips and advice to consider when setting up your deployments. The list of technologies and corresponding directories is below, so look for what you need and just ignore the others.

## List of technologies

| Technology | directory | External Link(s) |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| JupyterHub | jupyterhub | [Z2JH](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) |
